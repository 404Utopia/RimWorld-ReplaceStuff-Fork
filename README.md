[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/404Utopia/RimWorld-ReplaceStuff-Fork)](https://github.com/404Utopia/RimWorld-ReplaceStuff-Fork/releases)

A continuation of **Uuugggg's** original "Replace Stuff" mod for RimWorld 1.6.

## üîÑ What This Mod Does

Replace Stuff (Continued) allows you to replace the material of existing structures without having to deconstruct and rebuild them. Instead of tearing down a wooden wall to build a stone one, you can simply designate it for replacement and your colonists will upgrade it in place.

### Key Features
- **In-place replacement**: No need to deconstruct existing buildings
- **Material upgrades**: Replace wood with stone, steel, plasteel, etc.
- **Bridge placement**: Automatically places appropriate bridges for water/terrain
- **Cooler placement**: Install coolers over walls without additional construction
- **Blueprint queuing**: Works with RimWorld 1.6's new blueprint system

## üîß Development Status

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice**: I (404Utopia) am a **new developer** who honestly has **no idea what I'm doing**. I simply love this mod and wanted to see it continue working in RimWorld 1.6 when I noticed it hadn't been updated.

- Keep the original functionality intact
- Fix compatibility issues with RimWorld 1.6
- Maintain code quality (though I'm still learning!)
