[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/404Utopia/RimWorld-ReplaceStuff-Fork)](https://github.com/404Utopia/RimWorld-ReplaceStuff-Fork/releases)

A continuation of **Uuugggg's** original "Replace Stuff" mod for RimWorld 1.6.

## What This Mod Does

Replace Stuff (Continued) allows you to replace the material of existing structures without having to deconstruct and rebuild them. Instead of tearing down a wooden wall to build a stone one, you can simply designate it for replacement and your colonists will upgrade it in place.

### Key Features
- **In-place replacement**: No need to deconstruct existing buildings
- **Material upgrades**: Replace wood with stone, steel, plasteel, etc.
- **Bridge placement**: Automatically places appropriate bridges for water/terrain
- **Cooler placement**: Install coolers over walls without additional construction
- **Blueprint queuing**: Works with RimWorld 1.6's new blueprint system

## Requirements

- **RimWorld 1.6**
- **[Harmony](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009463077)** (required dependency)

## Development Status

**Important Notice**: I (404Utopia) am a **new developer** who honestly has **no idea what I'm doing**. I simply love this mod and wanted to see it continue working in RimWorld 1.6 when I noticed it hadn't been updated.

This is my attempt to revive and maintain a mod that I found incredibly useful. I'm learning as I go and doing my best to:
- Keep the original functionality intact
- Fix compatibility issues with RimWorld 1.6
- Maintain code quality (though I'm still learning!)

### What's Been Updated for 1.6
- Fixed compilation errors and API changes
- Updated logging system for new RimWorld API
- Ensured compatibility with RimWorld 1.6's blueprint system
- Updated build system and project structure
- Added automated releases via GitHub Actions

## Credits and Attribution
